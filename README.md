Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Software Engineer and a Computer Science student at UNISINOS, currently interning at Dell.

My main focus is **backend development** with **Java**, especially in designing and building scalable **microservices**. I am also enthusiastic about full-stack **web development** and I am always looking for new challenges to apply my skills to real-world projects.
